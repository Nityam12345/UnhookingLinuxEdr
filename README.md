# UnhookingLinuxEdr 🛡️

Welcome to the UnhookingLinuxEdr repository! Here, we discuss attacking the cleanup_module function of a kernel module, diving into the intricacies of manipulating the Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to evade Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. 

## Overview 🚀

This repository focuses on exploring techniques to manipulate the kernel modules within the Linux environment, particularly targeting the cleanup_module function. By understanding and exploiting these functionalities, we aim to develop a deeper understanding of how malware and rootkits can potentially bypass security measures implemented by EDR tools.

## Topics Covered 📚

In this repository, we delve into the following key topics:
- Cortex technology
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems
- Hooking mechanisms in the Linux kernel
- Kernel modules manipulation
- Linux Kernel Module (LKM) development
- Malware evasion strategies
- Research methodologies
- Rootkit development
- Trend Micro security solutions
- Trick techniques for evading detection
